File structure:

NASA9_chem_fig13 - Temperature profiles for models used in Fig. 13. These models use NASA9 polynomials instead of JANAF
f13 - temperature profiles for the f=1/3 heat redistribution factor grid. File name represents the model number
f14 - temperature profiles for the f=1/4 heat redistribution factor grid. File name represents the model number
f23 - temperature profiles for the f=2/3 heat redistribution factor grid. File name represents the model number
lavatmos - contains the temperature profiles used for models where LavAtmos 2.0 is enabled (Fig. 12)
