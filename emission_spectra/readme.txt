File structure:

NASA9_chem_fig13 - Emission spectra for models used in Fig. 13. These models use NASA9 polynomials instead of JANAF
f13 - Emission spectra for the f=1/3 heat redistribution factor grid. File name represents the model number
f14 - Emission spectra for the f=1/4 heat redistribution factor grid. File name represents the model number
f23 - Emission spectra for the f=2/3 heat redistribution factor grid. File name represents the model number
lavatmos - Emission spectra for models where LavAtmos 2.0 is enabled (Fig. 12)

All models are in the format of Fp/Fs where Fp = planet flux and Fs = star flux
The wavelength units are in micron, the flux is in ppm
