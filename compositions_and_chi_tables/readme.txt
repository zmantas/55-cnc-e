Here you can find the composition table and the chi squared tables for all the models.

Available formats: csv (individual tables), xlsx, google sheet via link.

Tab labels for chi tables:
  f=1/4 (*)
  f=1/3 (*)
  f=2/3 (*)
  blackbody (*)

  'f' refers to the heat redistribution value
  '*' refers to the reduction of the data
  'blackbody' assuming simple blackbody models with no atmosphere
  some tabs contain 'wPhotometry', which refers to cases where MIRI photometry is added
  

Analysed reductions are: Eureka!, SPARTA, stark (V1-V5), where 'V' refers to the NIRCam visit.

Different reductions are for the NIRCam data.
Eureka! and SPARTA from Hu et al. 2024; stark from Patel et al. 2024

column labels for chi tables:
  chi_full(#): chi squared values for the combined NIRCam and MIRI spectrum
  chi_nircam(#): chi squared values for the NIRCam spectrum
  chi_miri(#): chi squared values for the MIRI spectrum
  chi_miri_wo_shadow(#): chi squared values for the MIRI spectrum without the shadowed region (last two points)
  chi_full_wo_shadow(#): chi squared values for the combined NIRCam and MIRI spectrum without the shadowed region (last two points)
  nircam_offset: the offset used for the absolute flux of NIRCam
  run: run number of the model, which corresponds to the comp_numberi n the Compositions tab. Blacbkody tabs have blackbody_0.23.dat for the 3 numbers is the heat redistribution value between 0.00 and 1.00

  '#' refers to the number of data points used for the chi calculation
